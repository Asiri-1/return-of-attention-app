            <strong>PAHM (Present Attention and Happiness Matrix) is the ultimate tool for achieving happiness that stays</strong>. 
            As described in "The Return of Attention" book, this powerful framework helps you understand and track your attention patterns, 
            revealing where your mind habitually goes and how these patterns affect your overall wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike temporary happiness that depends on changing circumstances, PAHM practice develops a foundation for 
            lasting happiness through awareness and acceptance of your mental patterns. By simply observing without judgment, 
            you cultivate a stable happiness that remains regardless of external conditions.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Orientation:</strong> Past, Present, or Future</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Charge:</strong> Likes (Attachment), Neutral, or Dislikes (Aversion)</li>

                <p>For PAHM practice, set a timer for at least 30 minutes. Longer durations (45-60 minutes or more) allow for deeper practice and more accurate tracking.</p>

                <p>After your session, review your distribution and reflect on your experience. What patterns do you notice? How did different positions feel? This reflection deepens your self-understanding.</p>

            not striving to change your experience.

          <h2>The Philosophy Behind PAHM</h2>
          <p>
            As described in "The Return of Attention," PAHM is based on the understanding that lasting happiness comes not from 
            controlling our experiences, but from developing awareness of our attention patterns. When we observe without judgment 
            where our attention naturally goes, we gain freedom from the automatic reactions that cause suffering.
          </p>
          <p>
            PAHM practice reveals that happiness that stays is available in any moment through awareness itself, 
            regardless of circumstances. This is why PAHM is considered the ultimate tool for achieving lasting happiness - 
            it works with any experience, requires no special conditions, and develops a capacity for wellbeing that remains 
            stable through life's inevitable changes.
